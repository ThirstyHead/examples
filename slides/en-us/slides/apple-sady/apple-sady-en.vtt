00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.620
people think that having a disability is

2
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:20.390
a barrier but that's not a way I see it

3
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.790
you can catch up with friends you can

4
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.730
capture a moment with your family face

5
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.200
small face focus long

6
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.620
and you can start the day bright and

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.640

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.270
you can concentrate on every word of the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.560
story a bird began to sing Jack open his

11
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:08.300
eyes you can take the long way home

12
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:26.790
or edit a film like this one

13
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.320
when technology is designed for everyone

14
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.570
it lets anyone do what they love

15
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.780
